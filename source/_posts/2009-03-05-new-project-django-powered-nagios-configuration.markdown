It's time for a new private project: The Django-powered Nagios configuration.

The idea resulted in reading the book "Python Web Development with Django". One of the authors describes one of his projects for internal use: a Nagios config manager and i think it's a great idea. I just played around with the idea but it got pretty usable so far. It's not in a production ready state but as soon as it may be usable to you i will release it. Here's a development screenshot:
